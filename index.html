    <h1>Off case</h1>
    <h2>Dis-Ads</h2>
    <p>The first of the off case postions is the simplest and  is called a Dis-ad. DAs are made up of 4 main parts. The first 
       part of the DA is the Uniqueness claim. This claim just states that the AFF is causing a unique problem. This just means 
       that in the status quo this porblem does not exist. This claim is important as it shows the Aff increases or makes something 
       newly bad, an example of this would be "The IRS is on the brink of success but can't be distracted". The second part is the Link which shows the way the AFF actually causes something. One example could be that "UBI 
       Stresses the IRS". This just shows the Aff actually does something. The next part is the internal link which would be like "
       The IRS stops terrorism". This is again just showing that the AFF links to something. The final part is the Impact which just
       explains why something is bad. An example of this would be "Terrorism is bad and kills people". In this way the DA shows how
       the AFF actually causes terrorism by distracting the IRS which is fine right now and which is supposes to stop terrorism.

    <h2>Counter Plans</h2>
    <p> A counter plan is a really simple of case position. It basically just says we could do the plan better by changing something 
      about it. This is usualy the actor of the plan. One example would be that instead of the Federal governemnt carrying out a UBI 
      the 50 states should carry out a UBI. The main thing one needs to prove is that the CP works better then the plan while still 
      keeping its advantages. The way to answer this off case if by perming it. This means to say "hey if we can do both lets just do both".
      The way to answer a perm is just generic the world of the perm is bad or worse then the the world of the cp. The aff must also defends
      that the counterplan fails without the perm.

      
    </p>
<h2> Topicality</h2>
<p> The topicality argument is an off case that is about the prompt itself. For example if the prompt is "The United States Federal gov't should substantially increas fiscal redistribution by means of a basic income, a federal jobs guarantee, or social security"
  and someone ran a plan text about Canada taking peoples money then yo uowuld run a topicality argument. This means their aff is not 
  topical to the prompt. This is usually on specific words of the resolution like if someones aff doesn't redistribute
  then you can run a T. A T is made up of 2 main parts the VIolation and the standards. The violation is what the aff did wrong
  as in they didn't answer the prompt ususally in the form of an interpretation of the prompt. The standards is why that is bad. This would be argued as hey their aff kills Neg ground and 
  explodes Neg limits. This kills fairness as we cna never respond or know their aff as it's completely unpredictable
  and this kills education because we can't learn about the actual prompt but just this random thing with Canada. The aff would respond
  by providing a counter interp of the prompt, syaing that they do meet the Negs' interp, arguing they are predictable, and by
  mainly arguing why their standards are better for their interp or why the Neg doesn't really have the standards they claim.
  On the whole the Topicality argument is just meant to hold the AFF to interaction with the prompt.
</p>
<h2> Kritik</h2>
<p> A Kritik is a critique of the underlying ethics and assumptions of the 1AC. A very common Kritik is the CAP K. This kritk challenged capitalsim
  THe Kritik has 3 main parts: the link -- this part of the Kritik basically explains how the AFF makes the problem worse and what the 
  AFF assumes. For a Cap K this would look like "UBI Increases Capitalism"., the impact -- this is just capitalism is bad
  because bad things happen, and then the alternative -- this would be basically a counterplan that argues for a better world such
  as a world where we reject capitalism. All of this is also usually read with Framework which is basically just saying "hey judge you
  should evaluate the entire round on who challenged Capitalism the best for these reasons -- insert education thing here". 
  The ways to respond to the K are a lot. You cna argue non-UQ, you could argue no link, you could argue link turn (Ubi leads to alternative)
  you can argue Cap good. Most important arguments are Perming the Alt as in 'lets do the Alt after the plan' and the Framework argument. 
  If you lose on Framework you will lose. You respond by arguing that the Neg's FW is bad and providing better FW.
